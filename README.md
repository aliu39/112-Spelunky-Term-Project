Final Independent Term Project for CMU's 15-112 Fundamentals of Programming course

An open-world platform game where the player must traverse a vast cave system, fighting giant snakes, looting treasure, and
searching for an exit before his torches run out, and he is lost in darkness.

Visual inspiration taken from the popular game Spelunky. Project explores cellular automaton and flood-fill/path-finding algorithms,
which are used to generate a unique, random map with each playthrough. Game physics and animations are self-implemented using the PyGame library.
